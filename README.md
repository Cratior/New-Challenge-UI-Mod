# New-Challenge-UI-Mod
Replaces the current SpaceFlight Simulator challenge menu with a custom one (featured in heroix's video)

This mod was origonaly only made for a single heroix video and used preset achivements but i later updated it to use sfs achivements **So there will be errors/bugs/problems**

`(Thanks to Cucumber Space for making the origonal base but i kinda broke that then remade it üòÅ)`

## What does it do
The mod uses the built in achivements so **does work with planet packs**, it then makes a custom ui that replaces the default challenges menu.
The achivements are rearanged into a piramid seperated by their difficulty, this can be "easily" changed for alternate versions by modify the code.



## Example
